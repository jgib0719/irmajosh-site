---

## Phase 5: Testing ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed:** October 25, 2025

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **HTTP 404 Status Bug**: DirectoryIndex conflict with RewriteRule caused internal redirects returning 404. Solution: Replaced RewriteRule with FallbackResource, removed DirectoryIndex from vhost config
- **HEAD Request Handling**: Routes only defined GET methods. Solution: Modified router to treat HEAD as GET
- **.env Permissions**: Changed from 600 to 640 to allow www-data group read access
- **Environment Variable**: Renamed ALLOWED_EMAILS to EMAIL_ALLOWLIST for consistency
- **Router Foreach Check**: Added skip for non-route items (e.g., _middleware key)
- **AuditLog Schema**: Fixed all queries to use event_type/details instead of action/message
- **X-Frame-Options Conflicts**: Removed duplicate headers from Apache configs (set in PHP)
- **Session Cookie Prefix**: Fixed session_name() vs ini_set() for __Host- prefix
- **Backup Script**: Removed --events from mysqldump (privilege issue), fixed tar --exclude position
- **Restore Script**: Fixed DB_PASS variable name, added GPG passphrase support, added gzip decompression
- **Database Privileges**: Granted LOCK TABLES privilege to irmajosh_app user for backups/restores

### Apache Configuration Changes
- Replaced mod_rewrite with FallbackResource /index.php (simpler, more reliable)
- Removed DirectoryIndex from vhost (prevented routing conflicts)
- Commented out duplicate X-Frame-Options headers (handled by PHP)

### PHP Code Changes
- src/router.php: Treat HEAD requests as GET for routing
- src/router.php: Skip non-route array items in foreach loop
- src/bootstrap.php: Use session_name() for __Host- cookie prefix
- src/Models/AuditLog.php: All methods use correct column names (event_type, details)
- src/helpers.php: Explicitly set http_response_code(200) in view() function

### Pre-Deployment Validation
- All services running (Apache 2.4.65, PHP 8.4.13, MariaDB 10.11.13, Postfix, OpenDKIM)
- File permissions verified (755 directories, 644 files, 640 .env)
- Database connection verified (irmajosh_db accessible)
- All 9 migrations applied successfully
- Composer autoloader optimized (PSR-4)

### Security Headers Testing
- ✅ HTTPS redirect working (HTTP → HTTPS)

- ✅ Tokens generated per-request

### Rate Limiting Testing
- ✅ File-based storage in storage/rate_limits/ working
- ✅ Limited endpoints only: /auth/*, /csp-report, /schedule/request
- ✅ 100 requests per 15 minutes enforced
- ✅ Tracking confirmed via filesystem

### CSP Reporting Testing
- ✅ POST /csp-report accepts violation reports (returns 204)
- ✅ Violations logged to audit_logs table with event_type=security.csp_violation
- ✅ report-uri and report-to headers configured

### Error Handling Testing

### Performance Metrics
- Landing page: 4.7KB HTML, loads < 500ms
- Health check: < 50ms response time
- HTTP/2 with Brotli compression active
- OPcache enabled with zero validation overhead

### Session Management Testing
⏸️ **DEFERRED**: Requires authenticated session from OAuth callback. Must complete OAuth flow in browser to test:

- Session destruction verification
- Session persistence across page loads

### Status
**All automated Phase 5 testing complete except session management (requires manual OAuth login)**  
**Site fully operational with HTTP 200 status codes**  
**Ready for Phase 6: Operations & Maintenance**
